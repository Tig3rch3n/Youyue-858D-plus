KKMoon-858D
================
*Warning*
The KKMoon version has the same ATmega 8A as the Youyue version has but they rearranged the pinout U_u
To Date nothing has been changed compared to tho original Firmware by madworm

Custom firmware for the KKMoon-858D (ATmega168/ATmega328)

There is a 'user manual' of sorts in the 'Docs' folder.

Please note:

Although this device looks very much like ones sold by 'Atten' and others, the innards
are not necessarily the same. The heater / wand are probably the same, but I know that
e.g. the 'Atten 858D' uses a different mainboard with a different brand micro controller.
The KKMoon version has the same ATmega 8A as the Youyue 858D+ version has but they rearranged the pinout

Naturally, this firmware will only work 'as is' for the exact mcu / mainboard combination I have.
Please see the 'Docs' folder for schematic and PCB photos.

Compiling/Development
=====================
There are currently three options available, choose your preferred environemt:
* Use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), make sure you do ISP Upload and _don't_ use the arduino bootloader.
* Use [Atmel Studio 6](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Atmel_Studio#Downloads) together with the [VisualMicro Plugin](http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-for-Atmel-Studio.aspx) for Arduino support, make sure you do ISP Upload and _don't_ use the arduino bootloader.
* "raw" text editing and Makefiles, to do so run `git submodule update --init` and afterwards `make ispload`. You probably need to adjust `ISP_PROG` and `AVRDUDE_ARD_PROGRAMMER` in the makefile.

The supplied `release.sh` only works together with the Makefile method.

Safety information / disclaimer:
================================

Making any modifications to this device may cause you irreversible physical harm or worse.
You do this at your own risk. 

There is a significant risk of lethal electrical shock, so if you still insist of doing so, make sure to
ALWAYS UNPLUG THE MAINS CABLE before dismantling the device. Check repeatedly.

If you have an isolation transformer - do use it.
